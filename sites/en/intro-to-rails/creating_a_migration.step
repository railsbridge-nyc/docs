    * `generate scaffold` tells Rails to create everything necessary to get up and running with topics.
    * `topic` tells Rails the name of the new model.
    * `title:string` says that topics have a title, which is a "string".
    * `description:text` says that topics have a description which is a "text". (What's the difference between "string" and "text"? Basically "text" is for strings that might be very long.)

explanation do

  message <<-MARKDOWN
    Here, `rails db:migrate` is a command provided by the Rails framework. It uses the migration file we just created (`db/migrate/201xxxxxxxxxxx_create_topics.rb`) to change the database. Database migration files can be crucial to code collaboration.
    `docker-compose run web <commands>` is a way to run commands in docker web service we specified in `docker-compose.yml` earlier.
