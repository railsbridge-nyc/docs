    Wait until your console shows that the Puma server has started (just like before).  Then, in the browser, visit <http://localhost:3000/drinks>

    1. Click on "New drink"
    2. Enter Cappuccino for the name
    3. Enter 135 for the temperature.
    4. Click on "Create Drink".

    (The window where you ran `rails server` will display debugging information as you do this.)

    You should see: ![Screenshot of the drink detail page](img/get_a_sticker_you_should_see.png)
